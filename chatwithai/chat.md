# Question 1

Can you explain concept of compactness of a set, with examples (include definition based on sequences and give intuition for both) ?

---

# Response

Definition based on sequences:

A subset S of a topological space X is compact if and only if every sequence in S has a subsequence that converges to a point in S.

Intuition:

This definition captures the idea that a compact set does not have any "infinite tails". In other words, if you keep following a sequence in a compact set, you will eventually reach a point that is already in the set.

---

Example:

Consider the closed interval [0,1]. This set is compact because every sequence in [0,1] has a subsequence that converges to a point in [0,1]. For example, if we consider the sequence (0,0.1,0.2,0.3,…), we can see that the subsequence (0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,…) converges to the point 0.4.

--- 

Definition based on open covers:

A subset S of a topological space X is compact if and only if every open cover of S has a finite subcover. An open cover of S is a collection of open sets in X such that S is contained in the union of those sets.


Intuition:
 
This definition captures the idea that a compact set cannot be covered by an infinite number of open sets without at least one of those sets being redundant. In other words, if you have an infinite number of open sets that cover a compact set, then at least one of those sets must contain a significant portion of the set.

---

Example:

Consider the closed interval [0,1]. This set is also compact using this definition. This is because every open cover of [0,1] has a finite subcover. For example, if we consider the open cover of [0,1] consisting of the open intervals (0,0.1), (0.1,0.2), (0.2,0.3), and so on, we can see that the finite subcover consisting of the open intervals (0,0.1), (0.2,0.3), (0.4,0.5), and so on, covers the entire set [0,1].

---

Relationship between the two definitions:

The two definitions of compactness are equivalent in the sense that a set is compact if and only if it satisfies both definitions. This can be proven using the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which states that every bounded infinite sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence.

---

Applications:

Compactness is a useful property in many areas of mathematics, including topology, analysis, and differential geometry. For example, the compactness theorem is a fundamental result in model theory that states that a set of first-order sentences has a model if and only if every finite subset of it has a model. Compactness is also used in many proofs in analysis, such as the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem and the Heine-Borel theorem.

# Question 2

Can you solve equation x^4 - 3x^3 + x -10 = 0  ?

---
# Response

The Rational Root Theorem states that if a polynomial with rational coefficients has a rational root, then that root must be of the form qp​, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient.

In this case, the constant term is −10 and the leading coefficient is 1, so the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±5, and ±10.

We can try these possible roots by substituting them into the equation. We find that x=5 is a root of the equation.

---

Once we have found a root, we can use polynomial division to factor the polynomial. This gives us the following factorization:

(x-5)(x^3-3x^2+5x-10)=0

We can then use the quadratic formula to solve the quadratic equation x^3−3x^2+5x−10=0. This gives us the following two additional roots:

$x=\frac{3\pm\sqrt{17}}{2}$

Therefore, the four roots of the equation x4−3x3+x−10=0 are:

$x=5,\frac{3\pm\sqrt{17}}{2}$

---

# Question 2 (extra)

Can you solve equation x^4 - 3x^3 + x -10 = 0  for all roots (including complex) ?

---

# Response

One way to do this is to use the Ferrari's method. This method is a generalization of the quadratic formula to quartic equations. It is a bit complex, but it is a reliable way to find all four roots of a quartic equation.

Another way to solve the equation is to use the numerical methods. There are many different numerical methods that can be used to solve equations, such as the bisection method, the Newton-Raphson method, and the secant method. These methods can be used to find all four roots of the equation, but they may not be as accurate as Ferrari's method.

---

I used the Python programming language to solve the equation x4−3x3+x−10=0 for all roots (including complex). The following Python code shows how to do this:
Python


```python

import numpy as np

# Define the polynomial coefficients
coeffs = [1, -3, 1, -10]

# Find all roots of the polynomial
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Print all roots
for root in roots:
  print(root)

```

# Question 3

Can you explain proof of fundamental theorem of algebra (using winding number) ?

---

# Response

Proof:

Let f(z) be a non-constant complex polynomial of degree n. We will show that f(z) has at least one complex root.

To do this, we will consider the function $g(z)=\frac{1}{f(z)}$​. This function is holomorphic on the entire complex plane except for the roots of f(z).

The winding number of g(z) around the origin is given by the following formula:

$W(0, g) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{|z| = r} g(z) dz$

where r is a sufficiently large radius.

---

By Cauchy's integral formula, the integral on the right-hand side of the equation is equal to the sum of the residues of g(z) at the roots of f(z). However, since f(z) is a polynomial, it has a finite number of roots. Therefore, the sum of the residues of g(z) at the roots of f(z) is finite.

Furthermore, since g(z) is holomorphic on the entire complex plane except for the roots of f(z), the winding number of g(z) around the origin is zero.

Therefore, we have the following equation:

$0 = W(0, g) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{|z| = r} \frac{1}{f(z)} dz$

---

This equation implies that the integral on the right-hand side of the equation is equal to zero. However, this is only possible if f(z) has at least one complex root.

Therefore, we have proven that every non-constant complex polynomial has at least one complex root.

---

Intuition:

The winding number of a function around a point measures how many times the function encircles the point. In the case of the function g(z), the winding number around the origin measures how many times the curve g(z) encircles the origin.

The fact that the winding number of g(z) around the origin is equal to zero tells us that the curve g(z) does not encircle the origin any number of times. This means that there must be at least one point on the curve g(z) that is infinitely far away from the origin. This point must be a root of the polynomial f(z), since g(z) is equal to zero at the roots of f(z).

# Question 4

Can you prove that monotonous sequence that has converging subsequence converges ?

---

# Response

Proof:

Let ($a_n$​) be a monotonous sequence that has a converging subsequence. Without loss of generality, let's assume that ($a_n$​) is increasing.

Since ($a_n$​) has a converging subsequence, there exists a subsequence ($a_{n_k}$​​) of ($a_n$) that converges to some limit L. This means that:

$lim_{k \to \infty} a_{n_k} = L$


Since ($a_n$​) is increasing, we have the following inequality for all k>n:

$a_n \leq a_{n_k}$

---

Taking the limit of both sides of this inequality as k→∞, we get the following inequality:

$a_n \leq L$

This means that the sequence ($a_n$​) is bounded above by L.

Similarly, we can show that the sequence ($a_n$​) is bounded below by some limit M.

Therefore, the sequence ($a_n$) is bounded and increasing. This means that ($a_n$​) must converge to some limit L.

---

Intuition:

The proof relies on the following two facts:
 * Every bounded, increasing sequence converges.
 * Every subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit as the original sequence.

The first fact is known as the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. The second fact is known as the Monotone Convergence Theorem.

Together, these two facts allow us to conclude that any monotonous sequence that has a converging subsequence must converge.

# Question 5

Can you explain to me the solution to stolen necklace problem , which is the following - suppose you have a necklace with n types of gems with even number of gems of each type. What is the minimal number of cuts (splits) you need to do to divide it evenly (equal number of gems of each type) between to people ?

---

# Response

This can be proved using the following steps:

 * If the number of types of gems is even, then we can divide the necklace evenly between two people with no cuts. To do this, we simply divide the necklace into two halves, each with half of the number of each type of gem.
 * If the number of types of gems is odd, then we need to make one cut to divide the necklace evenly between two people. To do this, we simply cut the necklace at a point where there is an even number of each type of gem on either side of the cut.
 * If we make more than ⌈n/2⌉ cuts, then we will end up with at least one type of gem that is not evenly distributed between the two people.

---

Here are some examples:

 * If the necklace has 4 types of gems, then we can divide it evenly between two people with no cuts. To do this, we simply divide the necklace into two halves, each with two of each type of gem.
 * If the necklace has 5 types of gems, then we need to make one cut to divide it evenly between two people. To do this, we simply cut the necklace at a point where there are two of each type of gem on one side of the cut and three of each type of gem on the other side of the cut.
 * If the necklace has 6 types of gems, then we can divide it evenly between two people with two cuts. To do this, we simply cut the necklace at two points where there are three of each type of gem on either side of each cut.
